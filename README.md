# SpotifyPlaylistTracker
A script to get the song names from a Spotify playlist made using Python :metal:

I was really bored while doing nothing in a saturday afternoon, so I've decided to update my playlists. There were a lot of songs in different playlists from Spotify that I used to listen, but never gave attention to save its names. An idea came into my mind, what about if I search for playlists according to a given string and saves it to a file
